  <h2>Book a Tour</h2>
  <p>
    The tour is much like a medium hike and requires a degree of agility and fitness. You can enjoy the tour without climbing the 106 steps in the Lighthouse tower. However, when you do reach the light room, you will always remember the view.

    For safety, children must be a minimum of 4 feet tall and must be accompanied by an Adult. Footwear suitable for hiking is mandatory. For safety reasons, Flip-Flops are not allowed.
